# npm resolution error report

While resolving: front-end@0.0.0
Found: @angular/animations@18.0.0
node_modules/@angular/animations
  @angular/animations@"^18.0.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer @angular/animations@">=13.0.0 <14" from @kolkov/ngx-gallery@2.0.1
node_modules/@kolkov/ngx-gallery
  @kolkov/ngx-gallery@"^2.0.1" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
