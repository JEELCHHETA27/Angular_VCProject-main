# npm resolution error report

While resolving: @angular-devkit/build-angular@18.0.1
Found: @angular/compiler-cli@14.2.8
node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli
  dev @angular/compiler-cli@"^14.2.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer @angular/compiler-cli@"^18.0.0" from @angular-devkit/build-angular@18.0.1
node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular
  dev @angular-devkit/build-angular@"^18.0.1" from the root project

Conflicting peer dependency: @angular/compiler-cli@18.0.0

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
